# PythonScripts

This repository is under development and code cleaning is needed.

However, the code offers solution to two use cases:
1. Complete exsting sprint, create new sprint, and start the created sprint (auto_sprints folder)
2. Transition issues between states with Windows shortcuts (shortcuts folder).
3. cron job to close and create new sprint automatically i.e. call autoprints skript.
