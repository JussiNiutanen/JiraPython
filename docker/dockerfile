#WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv
#WARNING: You are using pip version 21.2.4; however, version 21.3.1 is available.
#You should consider upgrading via the '/usr/local/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
